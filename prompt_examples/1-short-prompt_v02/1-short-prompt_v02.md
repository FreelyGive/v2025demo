Can you create a landing page for the Virtual FinTech Summit 2025 event?

Make sure to have an eye catching hero section with preline, headline, description, a button and thed date last, three feature cards, a checklist with roles that benefit using four icon tiles, with a sentence description per role and at the end a section with a text with the dates fairly small, a heading about reserving your spot and a text with some slogan under that, all inside the header slot and then in the main content the webform for the event on the left and an image on the right that is 1:1 ratio.

Find images with graphics that represent our company findrop or fintech in general, do preferably not use photos except for the last image.

Make sure to always lookup information from the database to get information about date and important information and make sure that the event is written out, like the date. Make sure to use our statement and slogans somewhere.

Please create the layout directly. No suggestions needed and also add some metadata to the page.
