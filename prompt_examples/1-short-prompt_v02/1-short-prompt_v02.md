Can you create a landing page for the Virtual FinTech Summit 2025 event?

Make sure to have an eye catching hero section with a button and information under it, some feature cards, a checklist with roles that benefit and a strong CTA section with a link to register. It should be added in that order. Use images with graphics that represent fintech and technology, not photos.

Make sure to search to get the information about date and important information and make sure that the event is written out, like the date.
