Can you create a landing page for the Virtual FinTech Summit 2025 event?

Find images with a girl in a cab using the FinDrop app and use them on multiple components. There are multiple images of her.

Make sure to have an eye catching hero section with preline, headline, description, a button and thed date last, three feature cards, a checklist with roles that benefit using four icon tiles, with a sentence description per role and at the end a section with a text with the dates fairly small, a heading about reserving your spot and a text with some slogan under that, all inside the header slot and then in the main content the webform for the event on the left and an image on the right that is 1:1 ratio.

Make sure to always lookup information from the database to get information about date and important information and make sure that the event is written out, like the date. Make sure to use our statement and slogans somewhere.
