Can you create a landing page for the Virtual FinTech Summit 2025 event?

Make sure to have an eye catching hero section, some feature cards, a checklist with roles that benefit and a two section with information on the right and the webform for the event. Use images with graphics that represent fintech and technology, not photos.

Make sure to get the date and important information about the event is written out, like the date.
