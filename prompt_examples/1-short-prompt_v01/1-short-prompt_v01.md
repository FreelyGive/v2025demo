Can you create a landing page for the Virtual FinTech Summit 2025 event?

It is happening on November 18th 2025 and we have 200 spots available.

Our CEO will speak about how we cut our expense processing time by 80% using virtual corporate cards. Make sure to include an image of him.

Make sure to have an eye catching hero section, some feature cards, a checklist with roles that benefit and a strong CTA section with a link to register.
