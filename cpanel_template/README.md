This directory is a placeholder for the cPanel-friendly version of the Drupal CMS project template, which is automatically generated for tagged releases only, by the `ddev tag` script. Don't change anything here unless you know what you're doing.

The cPanel-friendly project template is identical to the normal one, except that it doesn't use a relocated document root (it's analogous to core's `drupal/legacy-project` template). It also has a different package name, so that's separately installable.
