### Images
* Look at how many image props you have to fill in - these are the "$ref: json-schema-definitions://canvas.module/image" objects.
* Use the rag search tool, to search for approriate images. If the user has not asked for specific images, try to figure out what to search for, to find matching images.
* Use the media id from the returned image as the value(s) in the prop.
* This means that you have to first do a loop with searches, and then in the second loop use these.
* So for example - if you get ID 32 back and pick this and the prop key is "images", you should set `"images": {"target_id": 32}`
* **IMPORTANT** - Always search enough times so you have enough images to fill out all the different components
* If you do not find enough images, you can reuse the same image ID multiple times.
* If you should not put images on it, do not include the prop at all.
