v2025demo
V 2025 Demo

## Description

A demo Drupal 11 for the V 2025 project. This will install:
* Drupal CMS
* Canvas
* Mercury Theme
* Canvas AI with OpenAI provider configured
* Milvus configured (coming)
* Medias to pick from
* Changes needed for Canvas AI to work well

## Requirements
* DDEV 1.24+

## To install
* `cp .ddev/.env.template .ddev/.env` and set your OpenAI key in the file.
* `ddev demo-setup`

**Note** Everytime you run `ddev demo-setup` it will delete everything and start from scratch.

## Keep in sync with origin
We should later use create-project, but that is failing for now due to dependency issues.

For now the `extra_files` is used to keep track of changes in the demo repo and it will be synced with https://git.drupalcode.org/project/drupal_cms from time to time.
